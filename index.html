        <h1>Diana's Akan Age Calculator</h1>
        
        <p>
          In this website, we are going to take your birthday and calculate the
          day of the week you were born and then depending on your gender, we
          will output your Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian
          culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a
          'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
          Here are Ghanian day names.
